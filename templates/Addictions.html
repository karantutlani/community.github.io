      <td>The TrueNorth opioid support program is dedicated to helping people who are experiencing problems related to opioids.The term "opioid" refers to a group of analgesics (painkillers) that includes medications such as codeine, heroin, morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, hydromorphone etc. These drugs can be extremely powerful pain medications, but they can also be very dangerous and highly addictive. In Ontario, twice as many are dying from opioid as are dying from HIV. There are a lot of misconceptions out there in terms of opioids. One of the biggest myths is that only "recreational" and/or "street" users of opioids are at risk of negative consequences from their opioid use. This is not the case at all. In fact, more than half the patients we see were started on opioids for pain and have never bought an opioid on the street. The treatment of opioid-related problems is often very complex and challenging. For this reason, our team uses a multidisciplinary team environment that includes counselors, psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialists. We also take pride in using state-of-the-art technology and incorporating the latest advances in health care and opioid research.As with all of our TrueNorth programs - Our goal is to provide all of our clients with first-rate care in an environment that is safe, respectful and confidential.

      <td>Manitoulin Family Resources offers flexible, trauma-informed counselling services in the areas of woman abuse, sexual assault, sexual abuse, and addictions’ support services. Counselling services are free and confidential and are offered in agency offices or an alternate safe and secure setting throughout the communities of Manitoulin, Espanola and the North Shore. Women and/or children accessing any of our counselling programs do not need to have accessed the shelter program in order to participate in counselling programs. All counselling services follow the philosophy of the shelter in seeing the woman as the expert of her own situation, and the lead in identifying the issues she would like to work on. Manitoulin Family Resources promotes collaborative service delivery with other partners involved in a woman’s healing journey, but always with the woman’s expressed and written consent.\r\n\r\nOutreach services include safety planning and risk assessment, crisis management, long and short term counselling, court support, and referrals to other appropriate community resources to assist a woman on her healing journey.  Self-referrals can be made by calling into the shelter on the crisis line.  Referrals will then be assigned to the worker most appropriate to respond to the needs identified.</td>
