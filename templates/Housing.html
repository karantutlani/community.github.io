Persons experiencing *chronic homelessness will be supported in finding and maintaining housing with the support of a Housing Based Case Manager or Intensive Case Manager. Participants in the program will agree to pay rent and work with a case manager on a weekly basis, or more, depending on need, to achieve stable permanent housing and have a successful tenancy. Partners in the Network are: Le Centre de santé communautaire du Grand Sudbury, SACY, John Howard, Elizabeth Fry, Association des jeunes de la rue</td>
